The intention of this repository is to act as a portfolio of past work I've done. It is broken down by language, and then by project.

In all my work, I attempt to follow the four pillars of OOP - inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Some excerpts are intended to show off these concepts directly, but elements are present in most exhibits.
