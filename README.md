This portfolio and the work therein belongs to Joshua Hagstrom, reachable at joshua.hagstrom.00@gmail.com

The intention of this repository is to act as an exhibit of past work I've done. It is broken down by language, and then by project.

In all my work, I attempt to follow the four pillars of OOP - inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Some excerpts are intended to show off these concepts directly, but elements are present in most exhibits.
